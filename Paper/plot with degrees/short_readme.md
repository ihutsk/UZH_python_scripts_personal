# Short explanation

I used this code with data (csv file) to create that plot in the paper at Figure 3.

NOTE! The .py file has code only for the main plot, while the .ipynb has code for the plots with partial data - I used them in my presentation.
To make those plots you need the corresponding .csv files (I found it easier that way).
