# Short Readme

These files are needed to make the plots in figure S2 in the paper.

Bar plots are made one by one using `bars.ipynb` or the corresponding .py file. For this, we need `pair3_overview.xlsx`.

Figure S2.c is made with `graphs_p1vd.ipynb`, we need `combined_pair_1vd_2a.xlsx`
Figure S2.d : `graphs_hal.ipynb` for halogen bond, `graphs_hyd.ipynb` for hydrogen bond, `graphs_eslt.ipynb` for electrostatic.
Correspondingly, `combined_halogen_bond.xlsx`, `combined_hydrogen_bond.xlsx`, `combined_ionic_bond.xlsx` and `point_charges.xlsx` files containing data were used.
